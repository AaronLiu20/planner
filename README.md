                We wanted to design and produce a planner that can be used for organizing and documenting activities that you need to complete in your everyday life. This includes school, work, or any day to day chores you may have. Given we started this project because we were unhappy with what we were currently using to organize assignments in college, we would like to make it easy for college students to use especially. This means simply implementing easy ways for students to organize their assignments, start from adding some notes in Notepad feature, create events for each assignment, get a detailed schedule of each day and manage them among different devices. That is the main goal for the fully realized application. This planner uses the following technologies:

                Skeleton HTML with some basic tags
                
                CSS for styling and noun project for the icons
                
                Javascript that dynamically creates html and adds event listeners
                
                Firebase for for the database storage for both users and the events they created
